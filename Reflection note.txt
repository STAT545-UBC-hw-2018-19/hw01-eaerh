A short reflection upon Assignment 1 in STAT 545A:



A nice and short introductory assignment.
The repository was cloned to a local directory and the REAMDME was edited locally. The changes was then added, committed and pushed to github.com. 
The same goes for the Markdown document, it worked fine. 

This worked fine as a kind of introduction assignment to working with GitHub as well as editing and coding in R/R markdown. 




The reflection is put in the repository in case I don't get access to Canvas until tomorrow.
